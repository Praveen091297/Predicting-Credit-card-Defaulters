Prediction Data Description
The Client will send the data in multiple sets of files in batches at a given location. Data will contain the credit and payment record of customers.
Apart from prediction files, we also require a "schema" file from the client, which contains all the relevant information about the training files such as:
Name of the files, Length of Date value in FileName, Length of Time value in FileName, Number of Columns, Name of the Columns and their datatype.
Data Validation
In this step, we perform different sets of validation on the given set of training files.
1. Name Validation- We validate the name of the files based on given Name in the schema file. We have created a regex pattern as per the name given in the schema file, to use for validation. After validating the pattern in the name, we check for the length of date in the file name as well as the length of the timestamp in the file name. If all the values are as per requirement, we move such files to "Good_Data_Folder" else we move such files to "Bad_Data_Folder".
2. Number of Columns - We validate the number of columns present in the files, and if it doesn't match with the value given in the schema file, then the file is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder".
3. Name of Columns - The name of the columns is validated and should be same as given in the schema file. If not, then the file is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder".
4. Datatype of columns - The datatype of columns is given in the schema file. This is validated when we insert the files into Database. If the datatype is incorrect, then the file is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder".
5. Null values in columns - If any of the columns in a file has all the values as NULL or missing, we discard such file and move it to "Bad_Data_Folder".
